Creating a well-structured `README.md` is crucial for your library as it serves as the front page of your repository on platforms like GitHub. It should clearly communicate what your library does, how to install it, how to use it, and where to get help if needed. Hereâ€™s a suggested structure for your `README.md` for the `JsonPatchRules` Python library:

---

# JsonPatchRules

JsonPatchRules is a Python library designed to facilitate the application of JSON patch operations while enforcing customizable validation rules. This library ensures that updates to JSON objects adhere to predefined permissions, making it ideal for systems that require granular access control.

## Features

- **Rule-Based Validation**: Define rules that specify which paths in a JSON object are allowed to be updated.
- **Wildcard Support**: Use wildcards to specify rules for dynamic keys and array indices.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure that only permitted paths can be updated, preserving the integrity of the JSON structure.

## Installation

Install JsonPatchRules using pip:

```bash
pip install jsonpatchrules
```

## Quick Start

Here's a quick example to get you started with JsonPatchRules:

```python
from jsonpatchrules import patch_rules

# Define your JSON object and the patch rules
data = {
    "user": {
        "name": "John Doe",
        "email": "john@example.com"
    }
}

rules = [
    "user.name"  # Allow changes to the name field only
]

# Initialize patch rules
patch = patch_rules(rules)

# Define the new data to apply
new_data = {
    "user": {
        "name": "Jane Doe"
    }
}

# Apply the patch
result = patch.apply(data, new_data)

print(result.patched_data)  # Output the updated JSON object
```

## Usage

### Defining Rules

Rules are strings that specify the allowed paths in the JSON object:

- `"user.name"`: Allows updates to the `name` field under the `user` key.
- `"user.*"`: Allows updates to any field under `user`.
- `"array[*]"`: Allows updates to any element in `array`.

### Applying Patches

To apply a patch:

```python
patch = patch_rules(rules)
result = patch.apply(original_data, new_data)
```

The `result` object will contain details about the operation, including which paths were updated successfully and which were denied.

### Notes:

1. **Structure**: The README is structured to introduce the library, provide installation instructions, show a quick start guide, explain usage, invite contributions, and mention the license.
2. **Customization**: Adjust the text to better fit the specifics of your library or additional details you might want to include.
3. **Details**: Be sure to replace placeholder texts like `jsonpatchrules` with the actual name of your library if different, and update the GitHub URL or any other links when you have them.

This README template should give users enough information to get started with your library quickly and encourage them to contribute or delve deeper into its documentation.
